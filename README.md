# Plops: an Atari 2600 game

Turn on your lava lamp, slap on some Frank Zappa, and [play Plops like it's 1979!](http://mrspeaker.github.io/plops/) Then go marvel at the [majesty of 6502 assembler](https://github.com/mrspeaker/plops/blob/master/plops5.asm)!

Welcome to "Plops". It is set on a Sunday afternoon. On a tranquil lake. You are a well-to-do, mis-behaved rapscallion - out to destroy the fun of others.

The aim is to collect the stones that wash up on the shore (um, the small black dots) and toss them at the sailboats that drift across the lake. The longer you hold fire, the further you throw.

But beware the dreaded purple thingo that for reasons unknown incessantly fly toward you. Use your mighty up arrow to defy it! (its a bit tricky - i just played it then for the first time in ages - I must have just got used to it).

## Interesting note

I built this game after learning of the [Atari homebrew scene](http://atariage.com/forums/forum/50-atari-2600-programming/) in 2006. I had six weeks off work while I recovered from brain surgery and I used them wisely: learning 6502 assember, and the [bizarre intricacies](http://www.wired.com/2009/03/racing-the-beam/) of a 40-year-old technology. I ended up with just the beginning of a game, and there are more buggy bits than not-buggy bits. But on the other hand - I wrote a tune for it, so that's not bad!
